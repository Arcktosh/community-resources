### Why we Create Content

Content in any form (and believe me it has many) has the sole purpose of passing information. Outwardly, we create content to inform and in the process educate. In today's world, and for developers particularly, content has its creation has become an invaluable way of scaling education. If someone wants to know how to spin up a web server with node.js, a 10 video call to teach them would do the job. However, if a hundred people want to know the same piece of information, an introductory article or short video on how to create said web server would be a better use of your time. Imagine having to chat with a hundred people to share the same information? No!

As altruistic as it may sound, we mostly create content to pass information onto others in a scalable way. That's not to say that it doesn't come with benefits. 

### Benefits of Creating Content
- We get to pass on the knowledge we acquire and empower the people who read it
- You can get paid to do it - freelance or fulltime, lot's of people make a living creating technical content
- It helps build your credibility as a professional. Writing about something is a very nice way of saying you know how to do something.
- It attracts eyeballs and positively impacts your professional career.


#### But hey what can I write about?
A phrase ubiquitous in writing circles is *"If you get asked something 10 times, write a blog post"*, of course, I'm paraphrasing here but the sentiment is what's important. You can write about things you get asked a lot.
You can write about a problem you wish was documented. Ever solve a problem or fix a bug and wish someone had written a blog post or done a video explaining the solution? Yes, then be that someone.
And one of the most important things to write about is things you are learning, teaching is one of the best ways of learning deeper. SO don't be afraid to take that leap.

### Introduction to Technical Writing 
This is one of my favourite definitions of Technical Writing 
> Technical writing is an audience-centred means of communication that provides a reader with clear and easy access to information.

It puts a focus on the audience which in our case are **developers** and describes what characteristics your content should possess - **clarity and accessibility**.

#### Writing for Developers

'Writing for Developers' takes on many meanings in our context. It means both *how developers should approach writing* and *how we should write for developers*. Both very important perspectives that I will tackle in this resources.

*how developers should approach writing*

*how we should write for developers*

#### Clear Writing

The clarity of your writing is very important, even more so for technical pieces. People consuming technical writing expect it to be clear, precise and straight to the point. Clarity means having a set-out structure to your content, using correct grammar and spelling and making your sentences as simple as possible. 

#### Accessible Writing
Accessibility is about making sure anyone has access to and benefits from your content. Here is a list of things to look out for to make your content accessible.
- Use simple and short paragraphs to explain topics
- Don't assume technical expertise, make sure that your content caters for developers of all skill levels.
- Always have prerequisites if you're having people write an article folks are supposed to follow. This way they can get everything they need ready.
- Say the full form of all acronyms the first time you use them.

### Promoting your Content
Writing your content is one thing, getting people to consume it is another. I know it might be a little *cringe* to be all loud about the stuff you make but trust me, it's worth it. Promoting and sharing things you create means more people get to benefit from the stuff you do. Naming for a start is a great way to make sure people can find your content. Using Keywords from tools like [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com) and [Keyword Tool](https://keywordtool.io) would go a long way. 

Platforms play a huge role in making sure people see your content too. Here is a list of Developer-Centric Platforms to post on.

- [Reddit]
- [Dev]()
- [Hackernoon]()
