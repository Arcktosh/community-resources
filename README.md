As part of our commitment to give back to our Community, having noticed the various ways our community are coming together to make the Strapi Project a success - we've put together this resource to help members of the developer community contribute to open source projects outside of just code contributions.

For Strapi, we've seen non-code contributions in the following ways.
- Issues, Bug Reports and Project Dicussions in our [forum](https://forum.strapi.io)
- Articles and videos as part of the [Write for the Community Program]() in our [Community Content Repo]()
- Meetups Around the world as part of our [Global Meetup Program]()

Theres so much activity in these areas and we wnt to make it so that anyone looking to start contributing can start through this resource.
