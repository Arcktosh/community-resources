### Program Goals
We want to be able to positively impact our community in a meanigful way. With that in mind, we created the Strapi Community Stars Program to help members become better in focus areas while using Strapi as a vehicle to get there. Potentially, we hope to train...better Programmers, better Writers, better Speakers and better Community Managers.

### Program Process
> Have 1:1 call - to sync priorities and establish personal connection
> Stars confirm a focus area 
> We avail Stars training and resources and invite them to the Strapi Stars github repo
> We add Stars to website

> We have month check-ins
> Quarterly feedback/progress checks on focus areas
