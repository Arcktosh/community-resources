### Developer Communities

Loosely defined, a community is a group of people who gather in a space (online or offline), brought together by a common entitiy - either a goal, product, tool, or cause. Developers usually form communities around tools they use. You can have a Community of people who use a project like [Strapi](https://strapi.io) or people who have a passion for a a certain architecture like [jamstack](https://jamstack.org).

#### Understanding Developer Communities

Going forward from our definition of a community, we can say that a developer community is one that followers said definition with the exception that many if not all members are developers. People talk about the uniqueness of the developer architype, thier love for dark mode and unsweetened black coffee. To understand developer communities, we can start from acknowldging that they are human who have a diverse set of characteristics and behaviors. 

As we approach developer communities, we must go about it as we would any other person. With ...
- Empathy 
- Respect 
- Kindness 
- Honesty

and I say all this to dispell the various stereotypes that have plague developers. 

#### Understanding Community Interaction

I really love this quote from an article on [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202748/community-managers-video-game-development-reddit-discord-twitter)
> Community management brings a lot of compassion into technology.

I love it even more becuase it builds on my explaination of treating developers as you should treat every other human. 
#### Creating Inclusive Communities
Inclusion here means giving your community a space that makes every member feel valued, respected and takes awaya any hinderances that might make them feel too uncomfortoable to contribute in a way that is meaniful to them and the rest of the community. Inlusion means everyone feels free to be thier authentic selves free from judgement and harassment. Thi sis vru important when creating communities. 

Code of Conducts play such a huge role in making sure a safe space is created and members are respected. 
Mozilla has a very useful set of [Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) they are a reference point for many communities. It is important to note that creating a code of conduct is one thing, enforcing it is another. A code of conduct is only as strong as it is enforced and it is in it's swift enforceent where we can create inclusive spaces for our communities. 

You can find the Strapi [Guidelines here](https://forum.strapi.io/faq#guidelines).

**Tackling Our Unconcious Bias**

We all have some sort of bias that we've picked up a we've gone through life - be it from our upbringing, environments, culture or religion. These biases dictate who we are and how we view and understand the word around us. It is important that we recognise these biases we carry and the role they play in the way we interact with and communicate with people. This form of self awareness is important as we go about interacting with people in our community.
