### Developer Communities

Loosely defined, a community is a group of people who gather in a space (online or offline), brought together by a common entity - either a goal, product, tool, or cause. Developers usually form communities around tools they use. You can have a Community of people who use a project like [Strapi](https://strapi.io) or people who have a passion for a a certain architecture like [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org).

#### Understanding Developer Communities

Going forward from our definition of a community, we can say that a developer community is one that followers said definition with the exception that many if not all members are developers. People talk about the uniqueness of the developer archetype, their love for dark mode and unsweetened black coffee. To understand developer communities, we can start from acknowledging that they are human who have a diverse set of characteristics and behaviors.

As we approach developer communities, we must go about it as we would any other person. With ...

- Empathy
- Respect
- Kindness
- Honesty

and I say all this to dispel the various stereotypes that have plague developers.

#### Understanding Community Interaction

I really love this quote from an article on [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202748/community-managers-video-game-development-reddit-discord-twitter)

> Community management brings a lot of compassion into technology.

I love it even more because it builds on my explanation of treating developers as you should treat every other human.

#### Creating Inclusive Communities

Inclusion here means giving your community a space that makes every member feel valued, respected and takes away any hindrances that might make them feel too uncomfortable to contribute in a way that is meaningful to them and the rest of the community. Inclusion means everyone feels free to be their authentic selves free from judgement and harassment. This is very important when creating communities.

Code of Conducts play such a huge role in making sure a safe space is created and members are respected.
Mozilla has a very useful set of [Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) they are a reference point for many communities. It is important to note that creating a code of conduct is one thing, enforcing it is another. A code of conduct is only as strong as it is enforced and it is in it's swift enforcement where we can create inclusive spaces for our communities.

You can find the Strapi [Guidelines here](https://forum.strapi.io/faq#guidelines).

**Tackling Our Unconscious Bias**

We all have some sort of bias that we've picked up a we've gone through life - be it from our upbringing, environments, culture or religion. These biases dictate who we are and how we view and understand the word around us. It is important that we recognize these biases we carry and the role they play in the way we interact with and communicate with people. This form of self awareness is important as we go about interacting with people in our community.

#### Why we use Discourse

We made a move to switch some of our community support and interaction from Slack and GitHub Discussions to Discourse. Discourse, as a forum software, provide a technical benefit to the users in our community by making the collective community knowledge more accessible. The root goal of the forum is to provide a simple place to ask questions and gather answers while also being inclusive of those who join the community many months after the question was asked/answered.

We migrated to Discourse from GitHub discussions in late 2020 in order to build out a tool with more potential ability than GitHub discussions could offer us. With the intent of expanding it's usage far beyond just the general Q&A.


#### Why we use Slack

We opted to keep our existing community Slack for the time being, at the request of our community, who felt it was still valuable to have a real time communications platform. While we are beginning to exceed the limits of our current free Slack, and are looking to migrate to a new platform, we will always maintain a real time chat platform for our community.

#### Conflict Resolution

Nothing highlights the need for a Code of Conduct like a violation of it in the form of conflict. As mentioned above, enforcing your Code of Conduct is very important as it goes a long way towards creating an inclusive space. You must do your best to act in a manner that will defuse the situation while enforcing the Code of Conduct. It is also important to have a section in your Code of Conduct that highlights actions to be taken in situations of conflict. That and the mention of key contacts who can manage the situation should it be beyond your control make managing and resolving conflict better.
